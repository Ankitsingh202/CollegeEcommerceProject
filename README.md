# CollegeEcommerceProject
This is one of my college assignment about creating a ecommerce garment website . The current version of my website can be extended easily to create a fully functional website This website is just a basic template which can be extended . If anyone wish to contribute you can focus on the responsive part or on optimising the images as they are too big in sizes. Lazy loading of images can be a good idea. Another way of contributing is by adding animation to some of the elements.
